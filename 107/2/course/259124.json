The emphasis of this course is not in the theoretical development (math), but in the understanding level. Therefore, many examples will be given in the lecture to show how to apply the equations to real problems. The detailed contents are given in the course progress field.","schedule":"Week 1: Class announcement and introduction to machine learning (CH 1)\nWeek 2: Holiday\nWeek 3: Basics of spervised learning (Example: K NN), VC dimension, and regression (CH 2).
