Students learn to select topics, collect essential information, analyze the audience, organize materials, improve delivery skills, distinguish different types of speeches, and further to evaluate their own and others’ speeches. Each student is expected to deliver at least 4 individual speeches, and 2-3 debates. Speech topics will be assigned to students. Any modifications of the speech topics will have to be approved by the instructor. All student speech sessions must be videotaped.(*1)\nCourse Requirements: 　　Students’ responsibilities in this class include:\n(1)　　Attending class regularly and to arrive on time: a sign-in sheet to record attendance / a grade reduction of 10% of the semester grade for each session absence\n(2)　　Delivering speeches as scheduled:\ni.　　Students are required to present their speeches on the day scheduled;\nii.　　Make-up speech will be allowed only when the failure to perform is due to an officially excused absence or incidents under extreme circumstances\niii.　　The ideal time duration for each speech is 4 to 6 minutes. The minimum length of speech time is 3 minutes, and the maximum 6 minutes. Violation of the time limit (less than 3 and more than 6) constitutes a failure w/o points awarded. The time length for debates will vary due to the different formats employed.\n(3)　　Submitting to the instructor a speaker’s dossier with inclusion of the outlined speech as well as its full-length version, the self-evaluating commentary of previous presentation(s) and also blank A-4 size lined sheets for notes and feedbacks (see Appendix 1) when presenting the speech. Students who fail to submit the dossier as scheduled and also to comply with the outline format requirements (sampled and specified below) forfeit the right to deliver the speech and hence receive zero points.\n(4)　　Student speakers are also required to display your outline slide(s) during the speech.\n(5)　　Evaluating one’s own speech: all speeches have to be videotaped by the student speaker. Student speakers are required to watch their own videotaped performance, observe their own speeches, and compile all speech and debate evaluation for submission. Students are strongly advised to use their own videotaping devices. A complete electronic portfolio (on compact disc) needs to be established and submitted at the semester end.\n(6)　　Student Evaluation Panel: An evaluation panel comprising three students will be organized to be responsible for feedbacks and comments. Three panels will be invited to evaluate one topic of speech. Feedbacks and comments will be given orally at the exhaustion of the speaker list. Written evaluation report will be required for submission a week after.\n","schedule":"2009 English Public Speaking and Debates\nWeekly Syllabus\nWeek/ Date 　　Course Content　　Format\nWk1　　Orientation 　　Instructor Lecture &amp; Discussion\nWk2　　Guidelines to Public Speaking　　Instructor Lecture\nWk3　　Introductory Speech Group 1 &amp; 2　　Student Presentation\nWk4　　Guidelines to Informative / Persuasive / Analytical Speech 　　Instructor Lecture\nWk5　　Informative Speech Group 2　　Student Presentation\nWk6　　Informative Speech Group 1　　Student Presentation\nWk7　　Persuasive Speech Group 2　　Student Presentation\nWk8　　Persuasive Speech Group 1　　Student Presentation\nWk9　　Analytical Speech Group 1　　Student Presentation\nWk10　　Analytical Speech Group 2　　Student Presentation\nWk11　　Guidelines to Debate: its logic and format　　Instructor Lecture\nWk12　　Debate Preparation 　　Instructor Lecture&amp; Discussion\nWk13　　Standardized Format Debate\nGroup 1 &amp; 2　　Student Presentation\nWk14　　Debate Preparation 　　Instructor Lecture&amp; Discussion\nWk15　　Cross-Exam Debate Group 2　　Student Presentation\nWk16　　Cross-Exam Debate Group 1　　Student Presentation\nWk17　　No Class (January 1st)\nWk18　　Final Debate Match　　Student Presentation\n","scorePolicy":"Grading Policy: 　　(1) Academic honesty is prioritized in this class. Students should learn that plagiarism will not be tolerated. Students will fail the course without contention once an incident of plagiarism is identified in their submitted writing or presented speech.\n(2) The grading components are as follows:\nComponent　　Grade Percentage\nAttendance *2)　　20% (full attendance) (*2)\nIndividual Introductory Speech (extemporaneous )*3 　　10%\nIndividual Informative Speech (extemporaneous w/visual aids) *No notes allowed 　　10% (peer evaluated)\nIndividual Persuasive Speech_ Human Interest / Life &amp; Leisure Topics  *No notes allowed　　10% (peer evaluated)\nIndividual Analytical Speech_ Social /Public Concerns *No notes allowed　　10% (peer evaluated)\nIntroduction to General Speech Skills / Informative / Persuasive Speech\nGroup Debate 1 (Standard format) 　　15%\nGroup Debate 2 (Cross-Examination format) 　　15%\nFinal Debate Match (Lincoln-Douglas format / impromptu)*4　　10%\nSpeech Assessment Portfolio (Speech outlines, scripts audios, commentary notes and peer evaluation entries) 　　Required (*5)\n","materials":"Notes:\n*1) Student speakers need to videotape their speeches each time and submit the digital recordings at the end of the semester.\n* 2) Students are obligated to attend all class sessions. Each absence will generate 10% point deduction of the semester grades on the 100% scale.\n*3) All extemporaneous speeches allow speakers to deliver the speech with its outline and necessary visual aids, such as flash cards, posters and PPT slides. Student speakers who use a script at speech delivery will result in the total loss of the component grade.\n*4) The implementation of the final debate match is likely to be subject to certain contingent occurrences as the class proceeds. Exact date, format and related matters will have to be discussed and determined later in the semester.\n* 5) Students are required to submit the speech assessment portfolio at the end of the semester. Failure to submit the portfolio will override the grades received in other grading components and thus results in a failing grade.\n","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
