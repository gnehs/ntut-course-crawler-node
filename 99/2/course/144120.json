Britain, France, and Germany) imagines the East (Persia, China, India, Vietnam, Japan) or, to put it differently, the way in which the West represents the East to itself, and thus the course is as much a course in cultural miscommunication as it is in cultural communication.  The course will be a study in reality, illusion, fantasy, stereotype, desire, deconstruction, globalism, eco-theory, and ideology.","schedule":"Wk 1: No Class\n\nWk 2: No Class (Holiday)\n\nWk 3: 300 [2007]\nWk 4: Lecture on 300: Ideology\n\nWk 5:  Black Narcissus [1947]\nWk 6: Lecture on Black Narcissus: Desire\n\nWk 7:  Keys to the Kingdom [1944]\nWk 8: Lecture on Keys to the Kingdom: Stereotype\n\nWk 9: MID-TERM 40%\n\nWk 10: M Butterfly [1993]\nWk 11:  Lecture on M Butterfly: Deconstruction\n\nWk 12: Memoirs of a Geisha [2005]\nWk 13: Lecture on Memoirs of a Geisha\n\nWk 14: L’Amant [The Lover] [1992]\nWk 15: Lecture on L’Amant: Cross Cultural Love and Destruction\n\nWk 16: The Fly [1986]\nWk 17: Lecture on The Fly: Globalism, Ecology; Review of course\n\nWk 18: FINAL EXAM 60%","scorePolicy":"Mid term Exam 40%\nFinal Exam 60%","materials":"photocopy lectures","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
