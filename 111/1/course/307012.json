    "objective": "This course presents analytic concepts in computer network analysis. It is designed for the beginning graduate students who are interesting in computer networks. Students should have a mathematical maturity typical of undergraduate curricula in science and engineering, including calculus and discrete mathematics, as well as a course in operating systems and a course in computer architecture.\n\nThe teaching approach in this course emphasizes modeling, analysis and design principles used in modern computer networks, including the Internet of today. The subject material includes reference models, queuing systems, graph theory, routing algorithms and resource management systems. Case studies include Internet foundation protocols, such as IP and TCP, as well as Internet multicasting and differentiated service principles.",
