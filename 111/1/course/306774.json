    "objective": "The purpose of this course is to discuss how to use quantitative management decision-making models to analyze various management problems. The methods for solving the decision-making models include: linear programming, integer programming, nonlinear programming, hierarchical analysis process and network process etc. The course content is mainly based on case illustrations such that students can understand how the theory is combined with practical problems. Therefore, various practical application problems in engineering and management will be used to explain the models. Optimization software and decision-making tools will be used to solve the problems and assist in explaining the management implications of the obtained data, and perform model cost-benefit analysis.",
