    "objective": "Students will learn how to design VLSI circuits and systems based on a standard VLSI system design flow, where various electronic design automation (EDA) tools will be used extensively in the semester. Those EDA tools includes analog and digital circuits and systems. The main purpose of this course includes the following:\n1.\tVLSI Introduction.\n2.\tManufacturing Process.\n3.\tMOSFET Devices.\n4.\tMOSFET Wires.\n5.\tHspice Software.\n6.\tHspice Simulation.\n7.\tAnalog IC Layout and Practice.\n8.\tVerilog-HDL.\n9.\tSynthesis.\n10.\tDesign for Testability and Automatic Test Pattern Generation.\n11.\tStatic Timing Analysis.\n12.\tPlacement and Routing.\n13.\tDesign Rule Check, Layout Versus Schematic.\n14.\tLayout Parasitic Extraction and Simulation.\n15.\tDesign Verification.\n16.\tProject Presentation.",
