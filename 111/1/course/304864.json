    "objective": "This course is an introduction to statistical-based techniques for monitoring and improving the quality of products and processes. The course provides a comprehensive treatment of the major aspects of using statistical methodology for quality control and improvement.  Both traditional and modern methods are introduced, including state-of-the-art techniques for statistical process monitoring and control and statistically designed experiments for process characterization, optimization, and process robustness studies. Students will: 1) learn to apply control charts to monitor the quality characteristics of a product or process; 2) learn techniques for assessing how capable a process is of achieving given design specification, and 3) design and analyze experiments for improving a manufacturing process; 4) realize how the modern quality management system works under competing environments.",
