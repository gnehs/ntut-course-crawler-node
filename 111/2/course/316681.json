    "objective": "Seeing is a creative process that involves our eyes and mind to transform what we see into what we know, but sometimes the process is reversed—we rely on what we know to interpret what we are seeing. To draw what we see can, therefore, be a process of the interaction of seeing and understanding. The goal of this course will focus on this seeing, thinking, and drawing interaction while drawing architecture on location. This course introduces the concept of analytical drawing process, and how to utilize it in design sketching.\n\n1. Introduce the concept of analytical drawing process and techniques of freehand sketch. \n2. Develop the ability to see and analyze the three-dimensional characteristics of an observed object and encountered environment through analytical drawing process. \n3. Familiar with both conceptual and perceptual form of representation, and be able to take a visual note to document an investigated subject.",
