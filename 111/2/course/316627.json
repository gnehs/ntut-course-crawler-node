    "objective": "目前建築工程營建產業多賴以圖文資料溝通，文件易有失誤，會提高成本、工期延長、甚至於爭議之狀況。BIM 工具之運用，可有效提升營建產業生產力。各國政府已紛紛推出 BIM 的審照制度，我國近年來於公共工程招標已要求 BIM 技術之整合運用。本課程針對 BIM 運用於建築生命週期中各產業間的介紹及效益、實例分享，並於課程中指導同學針對 BIM 軟體基礎工具使用。\nArchitectural engineering construction industry on which 2D graphic data communication, the file is easy to form mistakes, will increase the cost of the extension of time, even controversial situation. The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) software tools, which can effectively enhance the productivity of the construction industry. Governments around the world have now launched the BIM audit system.\nIn recent years, Taiwan has asked the public works bidding integrate and use of BIM technology. This course focuses on the introduction and effective life cycle of BIM for architectural industry, examples of sharing.  Guidance to students in courses based tool for BIM software.",
