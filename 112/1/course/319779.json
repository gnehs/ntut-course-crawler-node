    "objective": "In the first semester, this course first introduces the core areas of physical chemistry by defining systems, states, and processes. Later, traditional thermodynamics is described and applied to understand the reaction spontaneous direction of macroscopic systems, including the explanation of the three laws of thermodynamics, to the description of thermodynamic behavior applied to gaseous and liquid systems.",
