    "objective": "本課程將探討明渠中穩定流、非穩定流、均勻流、非均勻流之流體特性。\nOpen channel hydraulics treats the motion of water in conduits that have a free surface, that is, in which the flow of water is not completely bounded by the channel perimeter and one surface is exposed to atmospheric pressure.  The flows can be steady (time-invariant) or unsteady, uniform (space-invariant) or non-uniform (gradually, rapidly, or spatially varied).  For engineers, open channels are very common for the conveyance of natural waters, storm discharges, sewage collection systems, and aqueducts for water distribution systems. Knowledge of the mechanics of open-channel flow, then, is important for the proper design of these facilities.",
