    "objective": "This course introduces students of engineering to those areas of mathematics which are important in connection with practical engineering problems. The material in this course is arranged accordingly in four parts: (1) First-order, second-order, and higher-order differential equations. (2) Series solutions of differential equations and special functions. (3) Laplace transforms.",
