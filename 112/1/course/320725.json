    "objective": "The major goal of this class aims to give students basic 3d modeling and rendering techniques meanwhile help them to have abilities to realize the design from concept to final output. In the class we will provide the tutorial of Rhino 3d. It's one of the most useful tools for interior and insustry design and have been widely used in different practices. Through practicing the commands and techniques with multiple exercises and practices, students will have general understanding about how the software works meanwhile get the fundamental abilities to get into design industries.\n  Student will be asked to finish a complete conceptual design project in the end of semester, it should be drawings, renderings, animations and one 3d model included. Students’ learning outcome must be showed in this package and will be the critical criteria of semester grading.",
