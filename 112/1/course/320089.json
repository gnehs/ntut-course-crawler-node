Part 2\nconcentrates on analog circuit and system. Method of biasing a\ndiscrete BJT or EET are given, and stability of the operating point is\ndiscussed. The small-signal model for each device is abstained and used\nto calculate the performance of low frequency single stage and\ncascaded amplifiers. The feedback concepts of AMP. OP AMP, its\ncharacteristics and applications are described.",
