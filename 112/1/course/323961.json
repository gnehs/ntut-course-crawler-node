    "objective": "The course content mainly introduces various physical methods used in the research process of inorganic chemistry. First, the basic principles of spectroscopy are introduced. The various spectroscopic techniques applied to inorganic chemistry and solid materials will then be discussed in more depth. Including: various absorption spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction and other commonly used analytical techniques in chemistry are also included in the course discussion. The content includes chemical bonds, molecular vibrations, electronic spectra of transition metal compounds, atomic cluster compounds and crystal structures.",
