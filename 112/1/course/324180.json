    "objective": "This course will focus on machine learning rather than hand-crafted knowledge engineering, due to the increased availability of data, computing resources, and new algorithms.\n\nDeep learning, probabilistic programming, and multi-agent systems receive expanded coverage, each with their own chapters.\n\nThe coverage of natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision has been updated to reflect the impact of deep learning.\n\nThe robotics chapter now includes robots that interact with humans and the application of reinforcement learning to robotics.",
