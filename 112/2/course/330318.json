    "objective": "This course is to introduce a serials of biomaterials and their functions. Begins from bacterial, plant, and animal cells and the differences between these cell organs. To learn of DNA, RNA, proteins, and enzymes base on their structures and functions. The characters of 20 amino acids and 4 nucleotides will be studied in detail. Carbohydrates and lipids are learned by their specific functions.",
