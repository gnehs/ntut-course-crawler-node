    "objective": "This course will teach students kinematic analysis methods, trajectory motion technologies, dynamic analysis methods, and force control methods for manipulators and robot arms. It will enable students to perform robotics research and develop applications in the future. This course first introduces the architectures and industrial applications of various fix-based manipulators and robot arms. Subsequently, this course will cover detailed methods and technologies including kinematic analysis, path and trajectory planning, dynamic analysis, and control design and analysis.",
