    "objective": "This course introduces the concepts, techniques, and applications of machine learning. Topics mainly include Symbolists (e.g., Decision Tree), Connectionists (e.g., Artificial Neural Networks), Bayesians (e.g., Hidden Markov Model), Analogizers (e.g., kNN), and Evolutionaries (e.g., GA), Natural Language Processing and Speech Recognition. The lecture format will be a combination of slide presentation, chalk talk and computer demonstration. In addition to the theoretical study, students are guided to survey the related references, discuss and brainstorm by group, and conduct the practice projects, so that the capability of creativity and innovation can be developed during the course.",
