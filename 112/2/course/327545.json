    "objective": "The major goal of this class aims to give students advanced 3d modeling and animating techniques meanwhile help them to have abilities to realize the design from concept to final output. In the class we will provide the advanced tutorial of Blender and 3d Coat. Blender now is the most useful tools for animation design and have been widely used in different practices, and 3d Coat is a advanced tool for digital sculpting and PBR texture paint tool.Through practicing the commands and techniques with multiple exercises and practices, students will have general understanding about how the software works meanwhile get the fundamental abilities to get into design industries.\n  Student will be asked to finish a complete conceptual design project in the end of semester, it should be drawings, renderings, animations and one 3d model included. Students’ learning outcome must be showed in this package and will be the critical criteria of semester grading.\n\n電腦輔助設計進階應用。訓練學生以軟體輔助操作進行靜、動態的三維設計與呈現。",
