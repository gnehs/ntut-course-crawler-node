    "objective": "彈性力學為固體力學的重要分支，研究彈性物體在外力和其他外界因素（包括外力、溫度、電磁場等）作用下產生的變形和內力。彈性力學廣泛應用於建築、機械、化工、航太等工程領域，是學習有限元素法、複合材料力學、破裂力學和疲勞等的基礎課程，對於培養學生的專業基礎，思維方法和獨立工作能力有著重要意義。\nElasticity is a branch of Solid mechanics that deals with determination of the stress, strain, and displacement distribution in an elastic solid under the influence of external forces. This subject has applications in many engineering and scientific fields such as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, materials engineering, and aeronautical and aerospace engineering. The subject also provides the basis for more advanced work in finite element analysis, mechanics of composite materials, fracture mechanics.",
