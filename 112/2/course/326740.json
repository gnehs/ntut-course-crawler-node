    "objective": "This course is an introduction to statistical computing and will be taught in Python. Python is widely used not only in the engineering but also in natural science, medicine, biology, physics, and business. This course will introduce you to a vibrant and growing community of open source data analysts that is pushing the state of the art in data analysis and presentation. (Another benefit to you as students is that open source software is free!) This course’s main objective is to: learn how to take raw data, explore it, and present the results in a useful way. Thus, in this course, you will learn all of the basic skills needed to do each of these steps with the statistical language Python.",
