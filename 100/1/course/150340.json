It counts 20% of the final grade for graduate students.\n2.Suggested topics: 3D video (multi-view video coding, depth estimation, view synthesis), H.264 scalable video coding, HEVC (high-efficiency video coding), H.264/MPEG-2 transcoding, H.264 error resilience and error concealment, wavelet-based image or video processing, and other emerging VSP techniques.\n3.You need to implement a VSP algorithm by yourself in C, C++, Java, or MATLAB. Programs readily available can only be used as references or a part of your code.
